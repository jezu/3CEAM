===== 1. 3CeAM 3rd Jobs Item Handleing =====
In 3CeAM, the item database has been edited to allow support for 3rd jobs. This was done to make all existing items
compatible with the new jobs, as well as add in support for special 3rd class items and equips.

Lets see how fimilar jobs handle items. Their's 2 things that set what jobs are able to use what item and equips.
The Job masks, and the Upper setting. Their's masks for base 1st and 2nd jobs, as well as some extended jobs, but lets focus
on the regular jobs. By setting a mask for a 1st or 2nd job and giveing a upper of 1, itl work for base jobs only. If the
upper setting was set to 2, the item would be accessable to reborn jobs only, if set to 4, it would be accessable only to
baby jobs. Adding these number together make items usable by many jobs, like 1 + 2 + 4 would make 7 and usable by all of
the known jobs.

So how does 3rd jobs handle items??? Since 3rd jobs use upper masks, they require upper settings as well.

 8: Third Jobs

So how does it know what 3rd job to work for, and which not to work for? Use of job masks. If we wanted to make a
Rune Knight only equip, we would give the item a Knight mask 0x00000080 and a upper of 8. The Knight mask was given to
serve the same purpose as it would serve for a Lord Knight only item. Knight with a upper setting of 2. If we wanted a
Royal Guard only item, we would give the item a Crusader mask 0x00004000 and a upper of 8. Its kinda like the same thing
as makeing a item for a Paladin, but with a different upper setting set.

===== 2. Item Database Edits =====
Ok thats cool. So since these new jobs have their own upper setting, would all of the items in the item_db need to have
their upper setting changed??? The answer is yes, and one of our team member has allready done that.
So the item_db.txt provided with this mod has been edited to allow all items to work with the 3rd jobs. However, this means
that you will have to use the ones provided by us. Using the ones from eAthena's SVN or other sources will not work. Well
they will, but the items wont be usable by the new jobs.

===== 3. 3rd Jobs Item Database =====
All items for the 3rd jobs have been added to the item_db2.txt file in the database. This makes it easier to add, find, and
edit items. You must also use the item_db2.txt file provided through the 3CeAM team.

===== 4. New Item Settings =====
These are the new job masks and upper settings added to the item database
