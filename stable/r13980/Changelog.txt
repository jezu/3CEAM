11/10/2009
	r31 [Rytech]
	*Redid exp tables to feel more correct for orginal mechanics use.

	*exp.txt is the official exp table for the orginal RO mechanics.
	-Base 3rd versions are in the Base Normal table and Trans 3rd versions are in the Base Trans table.
	-All 3rd jobs are in the normal 2nd classes jobs table as their behavior is base jobs and their not trans jobs.
	-Support for levels over 99 WILL NOT BE SUPPORTED in this table since this is a official exp table.
	-Levels higher then 99 and needed exp tables for levels higher then 99 dont exist on the orginal mehcanics.

	*exp2.txt is for use for levels over 99. 3rd class get their own exp tables.
	-Base 3rd use a copy of the Base Normal table and Trans 3rd uses a copy of the Base Trans table.
	-This allows for a fixed level limit for 1st and 2nd classes, and a raised level limit for 3rd in case anyone wants the level 99 to 150 setup.
	-All 3rd jobs use a copy of the 2nd class Job exp table as these jobs are really like a base 3rd job.
